**Here are some points that will make us understand why this graph is better than the bad graph we saw earlier:**

1.  **Clarity of Data Representation**: The graph uses visual elements (like color, line thickness, or markers) more effectively, making it easier to distinguish between different data series. Clear differentiation helps in quickly understanding the trends for each demographic.

2.  **Interactivity**: If The graph is interactive, allowing users to hover over data points to get more information or to filter which data series are visible, this interactivity can significantly enhance understanding. Interactive graphs can also manage clutter better by letting users focus on specific parts of the data.

3.  **Scale and Axis**: The scale of the axes can greatly affect readability. The graph uses a scale that better fits the data and the axes are labeled more clearly, it is easier to interpret.

4.  **Data Density**: The graph displays the data at an appropriate density, with a good balance between detail and readability. Overly dense graphs can be overwhelming and hard to interpret, while overly sparse ones may not convey enough information.

5.  **Legend and Labels**: An effective legend, clear labels, and annotations can make a graph much more understandable. The graph has a legend that is easier to read and better positioned, it will contribute to a better understanding.

6.  **Contextual Information**: The inclusion of contextual information, such as highlighting specific events, helps explain spikes or drops in the data, making The graph more informative.

7.  **Aesthetic Appeal**: The graph is more understandable simply because it is aesthetically more pleasing. Good visual design can guide the viewerâ€™s eye and make the information easier to absorb.

8.  **Zoom and Time Frame**: The time frame presented in the graph might be more relevant to the context of the data, helping to tell a clearer story. Additionally, if The graph allows for zooming in on specific time periods, this could aid in understanding short-term variations.
