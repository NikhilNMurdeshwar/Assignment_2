**Here are some points that will make us understand why this graph is better than the bad graph we saw earlier:**

1.  **Clarity**: The graph is more clearer and easier to read. For instance, if it has a clean layout with less clutter, it makes it easier for the viewer to understand the data.

2.  **Color Contrast**: Effective use of color can significantly improve a graph's readability. The graph uses a color scheme that has good contrast and helps distinguish between different data series clearly, it would be considered better.

3.  **Axis Labels and Scale**: Proper labeling of axes, including units of measurement and a well-scaled axis that isn't misleading, contributes to a graph's effectiveness. The graph has more appropriately scaled axes and clearer labels, it would be more understandable.

4.  **Legend and Key**: A clear legend or key that helps users understand what each line or data point represents can make one graph stand out over another. The graph has a legend that is easier to follow, it will be more user-friendly.

5.  **Data Points**: The graph includes data points or markers that make the individual data values identifiable, this can aid in interpretation and make the graph more informative.

6.  **Readability**: The choice of font size, style, and the overall layout can affect readability. The graph has a better-designed layout and typography that makes it easier to read the text and numbers, it will generally be preferred.

7.  **Title and Annotations**: A descriptive title and useful annotations can make a significant difference. The graph might have a more informative title and annotations that help explain the data and any noteworthy points.

8.  **Interactive Features**: For interactive graphs, features such as tooltips, zooming, and filtering can enhance understanding. The graph is interactive and allows users to engage with the data more deeply, it would provide a better user experience.

9.  **Accuracy of Data Representation**: The most critical factor is how accurately the graph represents the underlying data. The graph portrays the data more accurately and helps the viewer to interpret the results correctly, it would be the better graph.

10. **Temporal Resolution**: For time series data, how granular the time axis is can make a difference. The first graph presents a more appropriate time scale that captures the trends without overemphasizing short-term fluctuations, it can be more informative.
